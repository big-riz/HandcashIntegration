      amount: 0.01,
      currency: 'USD'
    }).then(response => {
      console.log('Payment successful:', response);
      // Save transaction details to the database
      client.query('INSERT INTO transactions (details) VALUES ($1)', [response], (err, res) => {
        if (err) {
          console.error('Error saving transaction:', err);
        } else {
          console.log('Transaction saved successfully!');
